# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
  The Disaster Reporting Network provides data driven storytelling on natural disasters around the world. An interactive map was created to display earthquake data from around the world. The hope is that this interactive site will create "buzz" abour the Disaster Reporting Network. 

## Results
  GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website was traversed and earthquake data was retrieved using JavaScript, D3, and leaflet. The data was then plotted on a Mapbox map through API requests.
